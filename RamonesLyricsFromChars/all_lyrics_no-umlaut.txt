"I Don't Want To Grow Up"

When I'm lyin' in my bed at night
I don't wanna grow up
Nothing ever seems to turn out right
I don't wanna grow up
How do you move in a world of fog that's
always changing things
Makes wish that I could be a dog
When I see the price that you pay
I don't wanna grow up
I don't ever want to be that way
I don't wanna grow up
Seems that folks turn into things
that they never want
The only thing to live for is today...
I'm gonna put a hole in my T.V. set
I don't wanna grow up
Open up the medicine chest
I don't wanna grow up
I don't wanna have to shout it out
I don't want my hair to fall out
I don't wanna be filled with doubt
I don't wanna be a good boy scout
I don't wanna have to learn to count
I don't wanna have the biggest amount
I don't wanna grow up
Well when I see my parents fight
I don't wanna grow up
They all go out and drinkin all night
I don't wanna grow up
I'd rather stay here in my room
Nothin' out there but sad and gloom
I don't wanna live in a big old tomb on grand street
When I see the 5 oclock news
I don't wanna grow up
Comb their hair and shine their shoes
I don't wanna grow up
Stay around in my old hometown
I don't wanna put no money down
I don't wanna get a big old loan
Work them fingers to the bone
I don't wanna float on a broom
Fall in love, get married then boom
How the hell did it get here so soon
I don't wanna grow up

"Makin Monsters For My Friends"

Everybody said so man you could see it on T.V.
They stood there ashamed with nowhere to go
Nobody wants them now the kids are alright
Every day is a holiday and pushin' people around

I'm making monsters for my friends
I'm making monsters for my friends

Someone caught one I could see so myself
I had to call 254 so they wouldn't blame me
We wanted to know how much trouble there was
When we asked our daddy he said it's just because

I'm making monsters for my friends
I'm making monsters for my friends

I don't wanna open a can of worms and
I don't want any Spagetti-Os
And I could always tell when
someone is holding a grudge

I'm making monsters for my friends
I'm making monsters for my friends
I'm making monsters for my friends
I'm making monsters for my friends

"It's Not For Me To Know"

Easy come and easy go for me that was the fun
It was something that I didn't think was so bad
Now I'm lookin' out my window but I don't know
where I am
And I've give up trying to understand what I can't

I don't have any illusions anymore
I've done all that I can do
It's not for me to know It's not for me to know
It's not for me to know It's not for me to know

I stood under the moonlight to ill-luminate myself
Something I fell into from being kicked around

I don't have any illusions anymore
I've done all that I can do
It's not for me to know It's not for me to know
It's not for me to know It's not for me to know

No one seemed to notice seeing from smoke screen eyes
You can get what you want but I don't think it is true

I don't have any illusions anymore
I've done all that I can do
It's not for me to know It's not for me to know
It's not for me to know It's not for me to know

It's not for me to know It's not for me to know

"The Crusher"

Now I wanna wrestle in the garden
I'm on my way to stardom
I know I'm ready I know I'm great
But first I have to get in shape

Cause I've got my eyes on the Russian Bear
Gonna tear him up I swear
This guy thinks he's the champion
Gonna take his belt and beat him!

I'm the crusher king of the ring

I'm ready for a match with the Russian Bear
Gonna pile drive him pull his hair
I might have a foreign object in my trunks
I might have to use on that punk

Got the hardest hold you can put on anyone
If you're my victim you're beaten
I'm a lean mean fighting machine
Powerful and strong like King Kong

I'm the crusher king of the ring 

Started having second thought I was scared as hell
The last thing I wanted was to hear them ring the bell
I mean the Russian Bear could probably
tear me limb from limb
He'd probably grin be real happy with himself
This is not good for my health
I'm not coming out of the dressing room
And get beaten up by that goon

Go back to Russia go back home!
Don't wanna get a broken bone
Or a lump on my head
Ain't gonna hide under the bed

I'm the crusher king of the ring

I'm the Crusher

"Take The Pain Away"

I went out today for a walk in the rain
I was so sad and blue I could feel any pain
I was worried about everything my head began to howl
I am running away from myself there's
too many demons around here now

Everybody I don't know what to say
I wish I could take the pain away
Everybody I don't know what to say
I wish I could take the pain away

But that can't happen and everybody knows it's true
And if you have to know I'll never understand you
So if you have to go then you'd better go now
Go off somewhere safe I hope you will somehow

Everybody I don't know what to say
I wish I could take the pain away
Everybody I don't know what to say
I wish I could take the pain away

Everybody I don't know what to say
I wish I could take the pain away
Everybody I don't know what to say
I wish I could take the pain away

"Born To Die In Berlin"

Intoxicated by the orchids abandoned in the garden
Demanding morphine curse my soul is burning
Stranded in the sweet wonderings
Breathing the pale moon silver
Torn painted lips tasting the last drops of life

Sometimes I feel like screaming
Sometimes I feel I just can't win
Sometimes I feeling my soul is as restless as the wind
Maybe I was born to die in Berlin

I sprinkled cocaine on the floor
When no one was watching
I closed my eyes and I let myself sleep
Creeps and dirty bastards,
Demons waiting by my bed
There's no choice or difference,
No one seems to notice

Sometimes I feel like screaming
Sometimes I feel I just can't win
Sometimes I feeling my soul is as restless as the wind
Maybe I was born to die in Berlin

Kuess mich jetzt Maedchen,
Es ist alles wahr
Du kannst es lesen in der Morgenpost,
OK,
Der Winter wird wieder kalt werden,
Berliner wollen Amerika,
Von Menschen die sterben,
Unter den weissen Blueten 

Sometimes I feel like screaming
Sometimes I feel I just can't win
Sometimes I feeling my soul is as restless as the wind
Maybe I was born to die in Berlin
Maybe I was born to die in Berlin

Hey, there! There goes the Spiderman

In the chill of the night At the scene of a crime

Spiderman, Spiderman Friendly neighborhood, Spiderman
Wealth and fame, he ignores Action is his reward
Look out, here comes the Spiderman

Spiderman, Spiderman Friendly neighborhood, Spiderman
Wealth and fame, he ignores Action is his reward
To him, life's a great big bang up Whenever there's a hang up
You'll find the Spiderman!

"Substitute"

You think we look pretty good together.
You think my shoes are made of leather.

But I'm a substitute for another guy.
I look pretty tall but my heels are high.
The simple things you see are all complicated.
I look pretty young but I'm just back dated, yeah.

Substitute your lies for facts.
I see right through your plastic mac.
I look all white but my dad was black.
My brand new suit's really made out of sack.

I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth.
The North side of my town faced East and the east was facing South.

And now you dare to look me in the eye.
Those crocodile tears are what you cry.
It's a genuine problem you won't try
to work it out at all, just pass it by, pass it by.

Substitute my Coke for gin.
Substitute you for my Mum,

"Out Of Time"

You don't know what's going on
You've been away for far too long
You can't come back and think you are still mine
You're out of touch, my baby
My poor discarded baby
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

Well, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
You are all left out
Out of there without a doubt
'Cause baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

You thought you were a clever girl
Giving up your social whirl
But you can't come back and be the first in line, on no
You're obsolete my baby
My poor old-fashioned baby
I said baby, baby, baby you're out of time

Well, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

Yes, you are left out
Out of there without a doubt

"The Shape Of Things To Come"

There's a new sun Risin' up angry in the sky
And there's a new voice Sayin' "we're not afraid to die"
Let the old world make believe It's blind and deaf and dumb
But nothing can change the shape of things to come

There are changes Lyin' ahead in every road
And there are new thoughts Ready and waiting to explode
When tomorrow is today The bells may toll for some
But nothing can change the shape of things to come

The future's comin' in, now Sweet and strong
Ain't no-one gonna hold it back for long

There are new dreams Crowdin' out old realities
There's revolution Sweepin' in like a fresh new breeze
Let the old world make believe It's blind and deaf and dumb
(But) nothing can change the shape of things

To come

"Somebody To Love"

When the truth is found to be lies
and all the joys within you dies
don't you want somebody to love
don't you need somebody to love
wouldn't you love somebody to love
you better find somebody to love

When the garden flowers baby are dead yes
and your mind is full of red
don't you want somebody to love
don't you need somebody to love
wouldn't you love somebody to love
you better find somebody to love

your eyes, I say your eyes may look like his
but in your head baby I'm afraid you don't know where it is
don't you want somebody to love

and your friends baby they treat you like a guest

"When I Was Young"

The rooms were so much colder then
My father was a soldier then
And times were very hard
When I was young
When I was young

I smoked my first cigarette at ten
And for girls I had a that yen
And I had quite a ball
When I was young

When I was young it was more important
Pain more painful and laughter much louder, yeah
When I was young
When I was young

I met my first love at thirteen
She was brown, and I was pretty green
And I learned quite a lot
When I was young
When I was young

When I was young it was more important
Pain more painful and laughter much louder, yeah
When I was young
When I was young

My faith was so much stronger then
I believed in fellow men
And I was so much older then
When I was young
When I was young
When I was young...

"7 And 7 Is"

When I was a boy I thought about the times I'd be a man
I'd sit inside a bottle and pretend that I was in a can
In my lonely room I'd sit my mind in an ice cream cone
You can throw me if you wanna 'cause I'm a bone and I go
Oop-ip-ip oop-ip-ip, yeah!

If I don't start cryin' it's because that I have got no eyes
My father's in the fireplace and my dog lies hypnotized
Through a crack of light I was unable to find my way
Trapped inside a night but I'm a day and I go
Oop-ip-ip oop-ip-ip, yeah!

One... Two... Three... Four!

"My Back Pages"

Crimson flames tied through my ears
Rollin' high and mighty traps
Pounced with fire on flaming roads
Using ideas as my maps
"We'll meet on edges, soon," said I
Proud 'neath heated brow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.

Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
"Rip down all hate," I screamed
Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull. I dreamed
Romantic facts of musketeers
Foundationed deep, somehow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.

In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not that I'd become my enemy
In the instant that I preach
My pathway led by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.

Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect
Good and bad, I define these terms
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow.
Ah, but I was so much older then,
I'm younger than that now.

"Can't Seem To Make You Mine"

I can't seem to make you mine
I can't seem to make you mine
You fly around like a bee
Hurtin' everything you see
I try everything I know
To make you wanna love me so
The only things you do
Is try to put the hurt on me

Can't you see what you're doin to me
You fill my heart with misery
In every breath and step I take
I'm more in love with you

Can't go on like this
A little bit of love and not one kiss
I've gotta have your love every day
Love that's real and will stay
I can't seem to make you mine
I can't seem to make you mine
I can't seem to make you mine
I can't seem to make you mine

Can't you see...

I can't seem to make you mine
I can't seem to make you mine
Come back baby to me
And my misery
I give you love night and day
Never ever go away
I can't seem to make you mine
I can't seem to make you mine
I can't seem to make you mine

"Have You Ever Seen The Rain"

Someone told me long ago, there's a calm before the storm.
I know, and it's been comin' for some time.
When it's over, so they say, it'll rain a sunny day.
I know, shinin' down like water.

I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain
comin' down on a sunny day?

Yesterday, and days before, sun is cold and rain is hard.
I know, been that way for all my time.
'Til forever on it goes through the circle fast and slow,
I know, and it can't stop, I wonder.

I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain
comin' down on a sunny day?

"Can't Control Myself"

I can't stand still cause you've got me goin
Your slacks are low and your hips are showin
I take you girl as you're standing there
Your low cut slacks and your long black hair
Don't want you goin' round with no one else
cause when I'm with you I can't control myself

Defense is down and you've got me shakin
You've got me so that my nerves are breakin
If you got me, I like you girl
Your knees would bend and your hair will curl
You make me move, yeah, like no one else 
cause when I'm with you I can't control myself

I've got this feeling that's inside of me
It makes me think of how things used to be
It makes me fell allright
When I'm with you at night and we love

You hold me so with this quick temptation
This kind of feeling could move a nation
And I'm okay when I'm here with you
I do the things that you want me to
But do these things for no one else
'cause when I'm with you I can't control myself

I can't control myself 
I can't control myself 
I can't control myself 
I can't control myself
I can't control myself baby

"Censorshit"

Tipper, what's that sticker sticking on my CD?
Is that some kind of warning to protect me?
Freedom of choice needs a stronger, stronger voice.
You can stamp out the source, but you
can't stop creative thoughts.

Ah, Tipper come on, ain't you been getting it on?
Ask Ozzie, Zappa or me.
We'll show you what it's like to be free.

Ah, Tipper come on, it's just a smoke
screen for the real problems.
S&amp;L deficit, the homeless, the environment.

Hey, hey all you senators wives.
Better take a good look at your
own lives.
Before you go preaching to me.
You're definitions of obscenity.

Ah, Tipper come on, ain't you been getting it on?
Ask Ozzie, Zappa or me.
We'll show you what it's like to be free.

The irony it semes it seems to me
it's un-American policy.
Yeah, we'e come so far but still only to
find people like you with ignorant minds.

Ah, Tipper come on, ain't you been getting it on?
Ask Ozzie, Zappa or me.
We'll show you what it's like to be free.

"The Job That Ate My Brain"

Out of bed at 6:15 In a rush and you can't think
Gotta catch the bus and train
I'm in a rush and feelin' insane

I can't take this crazy pace
I've become a mental case
Yeah, this is the job that ate my brain

Go to work, it's such a drag
Face the boss, he's such a nag
In a suit and in a tie

I look so late I wanna die

I can't take this crazy pace
I've become a mental case
Yeah, this is the job that ate my brain

I punch the clock at 9:05
I know I'm late, but still alive
Everyone just stares at me
(I'm last in line for this party)

I can't take this crazy pace
I've become a mental case
Yeah, this is the job that ate my brain

Five o'clock rolls around
I feel so glad I kiss the ground
Ain't enough hours in the day
There's go to be a better way

I can't take this crazy pace
I've become a mental case
Yeah, this is the job that ate my brain

"Poison Heart"

No one ever thought this one would survive
Helpless child, gonna walk a drum beat behind
Lock you in a dream, never let you go
Never let you laugh or smile, not you.

Well, I just want to walk right out of this world,
'Cause everybody has a poison heart
I just want to walk right out of this world,
'Cause everybody has a poison heart.

Making friends with a homeless torn up man
He just kind of smiles, it really shakes me up.
There's danger on every corner but I'm okay
Walking down the street trying to forget yesterday.

Well, I just want to walk right out of this world,
'Cause everybody has a poison heart.
I just want to walk right out of this world,
'Cause everybody has a poison heart,
a poison heart, a poison heart, a poison heart ... yeah!

You know that life really takes its toll
And a poet's gut reaction is to search his very soul
So much damn confusion before my eyes,
But nothing seems to phase me and this one still survives.

I just want to walk right out of this world,
'Cause everybody has a poison heart.
I just want to walk right out of this world,
'Cause everybody has a poison heart,
Well, I just want to walk right out of this world,
'Cause everybody has a poison heart.
a poison heart, a poison heart, a poison heart.
a poison heart, a poison heart, a poison heart.

"Anxiety"

Anxiety, anxiety keeps me happy.
Anxiety, anxiety keeps me happy.
Always stieff, all day long.
Nothing's right till it's all wrong.
It makes no sense until I'm tense.
Always laughing at your expense.

Anxiety, anxiety keeps me happy.
Anxiety, anxiety keeps me happy.
Always biting on my nails.
Always stiff, it never fails.
Now it on my sweaty clothes.
Anxiety, anxiety keeps me happy.

Anxiety, anxiety keeps me happy.
Always screamin' at someone.
Got a temper like a gun.
Hair trigger personality.
Anxiety keeps me hap-happy.


And I'm crazy, crazy, crazy
In a crazy world.
I'm crazy, crazy, crazy
In a crazy world.
I'm crazy, crazy, crazy
In a crazy world.
I'm crazy, crazy, crazy
In a crazy world.

Anxiety keeps me high,
Cross my heart and hope to die.

"Strength To Endure"

Walking through the cross fire heart
Feeling heavy and hopeless.
Wonderin' how I ever willsee
Through this darkness.
Every drop of blood can be
So beautiful
And I sure was bleedin' the drops by
The bucketful.

I have the strength to endure
And all the love so pure
I have the strength to endure
Because... because...

I'm not afraid to tell her
Just how things work.
Ride a hurricane
Through the fast lane
Always looking over my shoulder

She said, "there's something about you,
And neon lights always gow hot.
Baby we can see this through,
Just give me all the strength
you've got".

I have the strength to endure

"Take It As It Comes"

Time to live, time to lie
Time to laugh, time to die

Take it easy baby
Take it as it comes 
Don't move too fast
if you want your love to last
you've been moving much too fast

Time to walk, time to run
Time to aim your arrows at the sun

Go real slow
You'll like it more and more
Take it as it comes
Specialize in having fun

Moving much too fast
Moving much too fast

"Main Man"

When I start movin, you see a blur.
Get hooked on me baby, there ain't no cure.
I've always been able to laugh at fate.
Two brown eyes filled with hate.

I'm the man who make 
the street his home.
And my lean, mean heart
Is just as hard as stone.

Oh, I'm my main man.
Don't want nothing from no one.
I'm my main man.
Always ready for what ever's gonna happen.

Spend my time in a cold jail cell.
Shootin' up poison, and livin' in hell.
And I never care what people think,
My history's written on me in tattoed ink.

And still life goes on;
Tracks on my arms.
And the number thirteen
Is my good luck charm.

What happens to me is my own affair.
If you don't like me, I really don't care.
'Cause no one's been what I've been through.
And I don't do what people want me to do.

I'll fight you till
The bitter end.
And then I'll screw
Your little girlfriend.

"Tomorrow She Goes Away"

Infatuation, she's a fatal attraction
Hang around, screw up my mind
I hope I've seen her for the very last time

(Dangers of drinking), but I don't want to die
Got to leave this cycle behind
I hope I've seen her for the very last time

And I can't wait 'til tomorrow
I can't wait another day
I can't wait 'til tomorrow
Tomorrow she goes away - ay, hay

Over my shoulder, I keep looking back
I feel a presence following me
So I know I'll never be free

And I can't wait 'til tomorrow
I can't wait another day
I can't wait 'til tomorrow
Tomorrow she goes away - ay, hay

Over my shoulder, I keep looking back
I feel a presence following me
So I know I'll never be free

And I can't wait 'til tomorrow
I can't wait another day
I can't wait 'til tomorrow
Tomorrow she goes away - ay, hay

"I Won't Let It Happen"

Got my sights, baby, set on you
The things she said, well, maybe they're true

But it's not gonna happen
I won't let it happen
I won't let it happen
Not again

Easy come, easy go, easily
But that's not how I want it to be

It's not gonna happen
I won't let it happen
I won't let it happen
Not again

Sitting all alone by the telephone
When are you coming home, oh-oh-oh-oh
When are you coming home, oh-oh-oh
Hey!

Easy come, easy go, easily
But that's not how I want it to be

And it's not gonna happen
I won't let it happen
I won't let it happen
Not again
Not again
Not again
Not again

"Cabbies On Crack"

Guided to a path, Broadway, 59
Took off like a blast
Almost lost my mind - oh, oh

Cabbies on crack

It first felt like at thrill ride
Excited for a while
Got pretty scary swerving at 100 miles an hour - oh, oh

Cabbies on crack
I want to get out, out of this yellow shell
I want to get out, crack cabbies straight from hell

And I don't wanna die before I live
Cabbies on
Cabbies on crack

Cabbies on crack
Want my money back
(Pieces of plastic mouse start to get in my mouth - oh, oh)

Cabbies on crack

Times Square was approaching
He braked for the light
At 90 miles an hour, that's why I saw my life - oh, oh

Cabbies on crack
I want to get out, out of this yellow shell
I want to get out, crack cabbies straight from hell

And I don't wanna die before I live
Cabbies on

"Believe In Miracles"

I used to be on an endless run.
Believe in miracles 'cause I'm one.
I have been blessed with the power to survive.
After all these years I'm still alive.

I'm out here kickin' with the band.
I am no longer a solitary man.
Every day my time runs out.
Lived like a fool, that's what I was about, oh

I believe in miracles.
I believe in a better world for me and you.
Oh, I believe in miracles.
I believe in a better world for me and you.

Tattooed your name on my arm.
I always said my girl's a good luck charm.
If she can find a reason to forgive,
Then I can find a reason to live.

I used to be on an endless run.
Believe in miracles 'cause I'm one.
I have been blessed with the power to survive.
After all these years I'm still alive.

Oh, I believe in miracles.

"Zero Zero UFO"

It landed in a field in Idaho
Where it came from, I don't know
It did not look like it came from Japan
And out of the dark walked a strange man

If you think it's a pack of lies,
I saw it happen with my own eyes
A million miles from the milky way
A hundred years, a month, and a day

Zero Zero UFO

(When media writes) the neon lights
Spaceship travels at the speed of light
A million stars in the sky 
(I here the Queen's on the alien's side)

If you think it's a pack of lies,
I saw it happen with my own eyes
A million miles from the milky way
A hundred years, a month, and a day
Hey!

Zero Zero UFO
Hey!

"Don't Bust My Chops"

I'm sick and tired of you calling me names
I'm sick and tired of your childish games
I'm sick and tired of your bullshit brats
Cocaine stupor and anxiety attacks

Picked up the magazine, I see your face
You're nothin' boy, a goddamn waste
With the lamest fashions on your back
You're never happy, a hypochondriac

Don't bust my chops, baby, don't bust my chops
Yeah!

You're a styling queen and an alley cat
Too many chocolates keep a fat man fat
You're a pain in the ass, and your on the (loose)
All I get from you is your bad attitude

Dirty mouth, it's all I can bear
Get outta here bitch, 'cause you're nowhere
Always wearin' that cheap perfume
Can always tell when you're in the room

Don't bust my chops, baby, don't bust my chops
Ah

Don't bust my chops, baby, don't bust my chops
Alright

"Punishment Fits The Crime"

I hear the bells of freedom chiming
And inside my heart I feel I'm dying
Wise guys never compromise
They they loose their rights and they act surprised
Jail really cuts ya down to size

Let the punishment fit the crime
The footprints on the sand of time
The philosophy of the poet's rhyme
Make a man humble in his prime

You can go up, down, or sideways
Be on Death Row, counting the days
They say the answers are blowing in the wind
And to take yourself out would really be a sin
You just have to cope and start over again

Let the punishment fit the crime
The footprints on the sand of time
The philosophy of the poet's rhyme
Make a man humble in his prime

Little child cries in his sleep
And life makes promises it can't keep
And then you had, had enough
You realize somehow, someway
Your destiny was planned from the very first day

Let the punishment fit the crime
The footprints on the sand of time
The philosophy of the poet's rhyme
Make a man humble in his prime

Let the punishment fit the crime

"All Screwed Up"

Without you baby's like suicide
I need you baby, that I just can't hide

"Palisades Park"

Last night I took a walk in the dark
To a place called Palisades Park
To have some fun, to see what I could see
That's where the girls are

I took a ride on the shoopty shoop
The girl I sat beside was awful cute
And when it stopped, she was holding hands with me

My arms were flying up, like a rocket ship
Down, like a roller coaster
Fast, like a loopty loop
Then around, like a merry-go-round
We even ate at a hot dog stand
Slam danced to a rockin' band
And when she winked, I gave that girl a hug
In the tunnel of love

You'll never know how good it just can feel
'Til it stops at the top of the ferris wheel
I fell in love, down at Palisades Park

Last night I took a walk in the dark

"Pet Sematary"

Under the arc of a weather stain boards,
Ancient goblins, and warlords,
Come out of the ground, not making a sound,
The smell of death is all around,
And the night when the cold wind blows,
No one cares, nobody knows.

I don't want to be buried in a Pet Sematary,
I don't want to live my life again,
I don't want to be buried in a Pet Sematary,
I don't want to live my life again.

Follow Victor to the sacred place,
This ain't a dream, I can't escape,
Molars and fangs, the clicking of bones,
Spirits moaning among the tombstones,
And the night, when the moon is bright,
Someone cries, something ain't right.

The moon is full, the air is still,
All of a sudden I feel a chill,
Victor is grinning, flesh rotting away,
Skeletons dance, I curse this day,
And the night when the wolves cry out,
Listen close and you can hear me shout.

"Learn To Listen"

Learn to listen, listen to learn

Tell me why is it always this way?
Where is Rudolph? Where is Blitzen, baby?

Sugar-plum fairies dancing in their heads
Snowball fighting, it's so exciting baby

I love you and you love me
And that's the way it's got to be
I loved you from the start
'Cause Christmas ain't the time for breaking each other's hearts

"I Wanna Live"

I've been thinking it over
And I know just what to do
I've been thinking it over
And I know I just can't trust myself

I'm a Gypsy prince
Covered with diamonds and jewels
But then my lover exposes me
I know I'm just a damn fool

I give what I've got to give
I give what I need to live
I give what I've got to give
It's important if I wanna live
I wanna live
I want to live my life
I wanna live
I want to live my life

As I load my pistol
Of fine German steel
I never thought I'd be so down and out
Having my last meal
But I know I can do it
It just took a few years
As I execute my killer
The morning is near

"Bop' Til You Drop"

Bop 'til you drop

No matter what
You just can't stop
Bop 'til you drop
Bop 'til you drop

Stick 'em up
Give me your money
You act like a big shot
But you're really a dummy
They want your blood
They want every drop

Bop 'til you drop
Bop 'til you drop
Hey!

You tried and tried
But you're a flop
You're thirty five
Still pushing a mop
No time to cop
Do the cretin hop
Bop 'til you drop
Bop 'til you drop

Stay away from danger

Farewell my friend

In the garden of serenity
In the garden of serenity
In the garden of serenity
In the garden of serenity

Meet me in the graveyard

On a midnight odyssey
Riding in my head

I'm not your enemy
Girl, I am your friend
Come with me on a journey
On a journey to the end

"Weasel Face"

Twenty four hours ago

Weasel face

For our piece of this world

Like livin' under
Your marshall law

For my own good
I would think it was true

Gotta be in early
Gotta go to school
They don't like my friends
I don't like those rules

"Somebody Put Something In My Drink"

Somebody
Somebody Put Something In My Drink
Somebody

Another night out on the street
Stopping for my usual seat
Oh, bartender, please

Tanqueray tonic's my favorite drink
I don't like anything colored pink
That just stinks...it's not for me

It feels like somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something 
Somebody put something 

Blurred vision and dirty thoughts
Feel (out of place), very distraught
Feel something coming on

Kick the jukebox, slam the floor
Drink, drink, drink, drink some more
I can't think
Hey! What's in this drink?

It feels like somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something 
Somebody put something in my drink
Somebody put something...in my drink...in my drink...in my drink...in my drink

So you think it's funny
A college prank
Goin' insane for something to drink
Feel a little dry

Oh, I couldn't care what you think of me
Cause somebody put something in my drink
I can't think
Hey! Give me a drink

It feels like somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink

Somebody put something
Somebody put something in my drink

Don't puch me around
Don't bring my head down

Don't treat me like an animal
I'm not a creature in the zoo

"Love Kills"

Sid was a punk rock king
Nancy was a broken queen
Their lives were so glamorous
Sid and Nancy were a mess

When you're hooked on heroin
Don't you know you'll never win
Drugs don't ever pay
You really did it your way

Love Kills

We still believe in anarchy
It makes me so damn angry
Sid and Nancy meant a lot to me
You may be dead but your souls are free
Like Romeo and Juliet
You two made a pact of death
Like the needle that ya used
Sid and Nancy were born to lose

Love Kills

Sid never meant any harm
He shot some dope into his arm
All he wanted was some fun
Now she's lying in a pool of blood
Always loaded, always high
Why did you have to die?
I'll say one thing is
It leaves me with a bitter taste

Love Kills

"Apeman Hop"

He's go so many problems
You can count them one by one
He's a filthy, stupid apeman
He never has any fun
He lives in the jungle in a cave by a hill
Plays an old loud drum 
He's primitive, barely human

Apeman hop, apeman hop

Paint the face of a demon, glowing by the fire light
Hoppin' like an elephant
Thunderin' like me tonight
He's the world's worst recycler
The iceman comes a lot
He's the devil's apprentice
He's a prehistoric man

Apeman hop, apeman hop

At night he's gonna sacrifice his beloved apeman girl
Tie her to the alter, pull out her heart and eat her flesh

Apeman hop, apeman hop, apeman hop, apeman hop
Apeman

"She Belongs To Me"

What makes you think she'll go with you
What makes you think you're better than me
You think you can read her mind
Maybe you're just looking for a good time
Maybe you can give her more
Tell me what you're doing this for
Stay away from her, 'cause it's making me angry

Don't tell me how to love my baby
She belongs to me

You come around looking for kicks
But I know all about your dirty tricks now
You think you took away my dream
Ain't gonna be easy 'cause I get real mean
Get out of here, get out of my life
You're gonna be sorry if we have to fight
Stay away from her, 'cause it's making me angry

Don't tell me how to love my baby 
She belongs to me

Don't tell me how to love my baby
She belongs to me

"My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down (Bonzo Goes To Bitburg)"

You've got to pick up the pieces
C'mon, sort your trash
You better pull yourself back together
Maybe you've got too much cash
Better call, call the law
When you gonna turn yourself in? Yeah
You're a politician
Don't become one of Hitler's children

Bonzo goes to bitburg then goes out for a cup of tea
As I watched it on TV somehow it really bothered me
Drank in all the bars in town for an extended foreign policy
Pick up the pieces

My brain is hanging upside down
I need something to slow me down

Shouldn't wish you happiness, wish her the very best
Fifty thousand dollar dress
Shaking hands with your highness
See through you like cellophane
You watch the world complain, but you do it anyway
Who am I, am I to say

Bonzo goes to bitburg then goes out for a cup of tea
As I watched it on TV somehow it really bothered me
Drank in all the bars in town for an extended foreign policy
Pick up the pieces

My brain is hanging upside down
I need something to slow me down

If there's one thing that makes me sick
It's when someone tries to hide behind politics
I wish that time could go by fast
Somehow they manage to make it last

My brain is hanging upside down
I need something to slow me down

"Mental Hell"

Evil in my head, in my head, inside this private hell
I'm not feeling very well 
Frustration, disgust, aggravation, disgust, mental hell
I'm not feeling very well 

Day, day after day, it never changes, always the same way
Day after day, day after day, day after

Demons in my head, in my head, inside this private hell
I'm not feeling very well 
Frustration, disgust, aggravation, disgust, mental hell
I'm not feeling very well 

Day, day after day, it never changes, always the same way
Day after day, day after day, day after

Do do do do

"Eat That Rat"

One-two-three-four

You don't want to share with anyone else
You got all the money, you got all the wealth
You got all the buildings and the factories
You got all the power (and the ceremonies)

You wanna play a game of cat and mouse
With the President in the White House
This is a hungry world, there are months to feed
There are millionaires with more than they need

Eat that rat 

One-two-three-four

Don't believe what you've been told
You can't change a turd into gold
Somehow we get all these creeps in control
It makes me throw up in the toilet bowl

You thieving whore, you hustle for bucks
You take the money and you shoot it up
That's the breaks, it's the chance you take
Get it together for your children's sake

Eat that rat

"Freak Of Nature"

I need psychiatric therapy
I could use a lobotomy
Guess I'll never learn

(Man I got problems, I'll bet you heard)
I'm completely misunderstood

Fa

I'm a monstrosity
I'm a human oddity
Everybody's staring at me
I'm an outcast from society
Freak of nature

"Hair Of The Dog"

When I woke up this morning from the night before
My brain was pulsating, I was battered and sore
Nothing I tried would satisfy
Cold Coke and Pepsi or Canada Dry

What's so wrong, hair of the dog
There's nothing wrong, hair of the dog

Finally pulled myself out of my bed
Feeling kinda dodgy, I was feeling half dead
Done it before, probably do it again
Don't know if I ever will learn

What's so wrong, hair of the dog
There's nothing wrong, hair of the dog

Hair of the dog

Finally pulled myself out of my bed
Feeling kinda dodgy, I was feeling half dead
Done it before, probably do it again
Don't know if I ever will learn

What's so wrong, hair of the dog
There's nothing wrong, hair of the dog

"Something To Believe In"

I wish I was someone else
I'm confused, I'm afraid, I hate the loneliness
And there's nowhere to run to
Nothing makes any sense, but I still try my hardest

Take my hand
Please help me man
'Cause I'm looking for something to believe in
And I don't know where to start
And I don't know where to begin, to begin

If I was stupid or naive
Trying to achieve what they all call contentness
If people weren't such dicks and I never made mistakes
Then I could find forgiveness

Take my hand
Please help me man
'Cause I'm looking for something to believe in
And I don't know where to start
And I don't know where to begin, oh no

I can't be someone else
I don't feel that it's hopeless
I don't feel that I'm useless

I can't throw it all away
I need some courage to find my weakness
And with your love, I know with all my heart I can win

'Cause I'm looking for something to believe in
And I just need something to believe in
I'm looking for something to believe in
And I just need something to believe in

"Mama's Boy"

Couldn't keep a secret
Got a concrete skull
Couldn't shut up you're an imbecile
You're an ugly dog there's
Nothing to gain
You couldn't shut up got a
Bad bad brain

Couldn't hold your tongue
You were just too young
Like a two year old you told
You told
You are all the same jelly
Bean brain
Every one's a secret nerd
Every one's a closet lame

Ma-ma-ma-mama's boy

Don't want to work in a hot dog stand
Be a busboy messenger or a doorman
It's an abstract world you're an
Abstract man
Abstract city don't give a damn

"I'm Not Afraid Of Life"

I am not afraid of life
Of the poor man's struggle
Of the killer's knife
I am not afraid of life
Of an insane rage
Of the minimum wage
I am not afraid of life

I am not afraid of life
I am not afraid of life

But I see an old lady with a shopping bag
And I wonder is life a drag

I am not afraid of pain
But it hurts so bad
I feel so mad
No one see the truth
There's nothing to gain
A life goes down the drain
Don't want to die at an early age

I am not afraid of life
I am not afraid of life

But I see a street crazy shivering with cold
Is it a crime to be old

There's the threat of the nuclear bomb
We know it's wrong
We know it's wrong
Is there a chance for peace
Will the fighting ever cease
Mankind's almost out of luck
A maniac could blow us up

I am not afraid of life
I am not afraid of life

But I get down on my knees and I pray
Is there hope for the world today

"Too Tough To Die"

New York city is a real cool town
Society really brings me down
Our playground is a pharmacy
Kids find trouble so easily

Other countries are just as bad
The soviets really make me mad
On the boulevard where police hide
Let's steal a car for a joyride

They say you're just an awkward kid
You flipped your lid you flipped your lid
You love wine like they love cash
Feel your rage spread like a rash

You flipped your lid you flipped your lid
You flipped your lid you flipped your lid
They say you're just an awkward kid
You flipped your lid you flipped your lid

All alone in the danger zone
Danger zone danger zone
All alone in the danger zone

She came from a happy home
A very happy home

Is this real or just a dream
And things will never ever be the same again

"Planet Earth 1988"

The solution to peace isn't clear
The terrorist threat is a modern fear
There are no jobs for the young
They turn to crime and turn to drugs
Battle ships crowd the sea
16 year olds in the army
Our jails are filled to the max
Discrimination against the blacks

Russians and Americans war machine
Will destroy mankind's dream
They shoot their missiles in the air
They do not care they do not care
Guerrilla armies rule the street
No more christmas or trick or treat
Is this what the future will bring
I pray for peace more than anything

The solution to peace isn't clear
The terrorists threat is a modern fear
There is no future for the youth
There is no hope for the young
Death destruction bombs galore
The rich are laughing at the poor
Our jails are filled to the max
Discrimination against the blacks

"Humankind"

Humankind, it's a test, to see who's the very best

People - always tellin' lies, they can keep their alibi
People - knockin' at my door, how come they want more and more
People - talkin' behind your back, most of them drive a cadilac
People - starrin' at your clothes - I can't take it anymore

Humankind, it's a shame, some don't even know their name
Humankind are so strange, some need to be rearranged

Humankind, don't look at me, look at yourself, what do you see

Beg. The humankind during intro part

Tell me, tell me, what's so wrong, if humans just got along
Tell me, tell me, tell me please, if psychiatric help is what we need

Something's always goin' wrong
Hair trigger temper tormented mind
Deadly spitten cobra I am losin' kind

The heart is the place devils congregate
When you're raised on andiet of bickering at hate
Hair trigger temper tormented mind
Deadly spitten cobra I am losin' kind

Soaring like a superhero
Past the end of Disneyland

Through dragon mist
Above alpine peaks
To the cloudy lace
To the highest trails above

I feel content
Send you all my love

Southern winds, shining rays
Are all I need for fight
Flying way past zero
Paradise is just in sight

Through the distant blue
Above the highest stars
To the silent dark
Send you all my love

I feel so safe
Flying an a ray
On the highest trails above

Sinking into the stars
Diving in for a swim
Soaring like a superhero
Past the edge of Disneyland

Most desired dreams
Happy endings too
Finally you find love

Flying an a ray
On the highest trails above

"All's Quiet On The Eastern Front"

Watch the watch the way I walk
Can't you think my movements talk 

See me silently quietly creep
I am too amped to sleep
Lamp rays shining down
Street lamps make the bussing sound
Subway creaking down below
Garbage piled up and ready to go

Lock the windows the gates on
Taxi in the distance coming along
Stalking the streets till the break of day
New York beauty take my breath away
Near some cats but dogs don't bark
Cool cats strolling after dark

Watch the watch the way i walk
Can't you think my movements talk 

Shaky lock and kicky door
Smokey air that I adore
Down in the alley is where I hunt
All is quiet on the eastern front

Stalking the street till the break of day
New York beauty take my breath away

Watch the watch the way I walk
Can't you think my movements talk
Watch the watch the way I walk
Can't you think my movements talk
Can't you think my movements talk
Can't you think my movements talk

I heard about the Easter bunny
Presents under a Christimas tree
It was dreaming and fantasy
There was no Mom or Daddy
I wanted everything
I wanted everything
I wanted everything
I had the world on my shoulder
But I was getting older
Knew I was ready for it
Some kind of employment
I wanted everything
I wanted everything
I wanted everything
All day working on a truck
Bringing the groceries up
Not much of a salary
No tip for the delivery
I wanted everything
I wanted everything
I wanted everything
There's no success for me
Involved in a robberry
There's money in the supermarket
And I'm going after it
I wanted everything

Kisses out of desperation

You bring out your souvenirs
Soak them wet with your tears
You lose your imagination
Out of more aggravation
And you don't come close
You don't come close
You don't come close
You turn red with rage 
But act your age
Only thing that you regret
You need more time to forget
And you don't come close
You don't come close

I saw her today, I saw her face 
It was the face I love, and I knew 
I had to run away 
And get down on my knees and pray, that they go away 
And still it begins, needles and pins 
Because of all my pride, the tears I gotta hide 
Oh I thought I was smart, I stole her heart 
I didn't think I'd do, but now I see 
She's worth to him than me, let her go ahead 
Take his love instead, and one day she will see
Just how to say please, and get down on her knees
Oh that's how it begins, she'll feel those needle and pins
Hurtin' her, hurtin' her
Why can't I stop, and tell myself I'm wrong, I'm wrong, so wrong
Why can't I stand up, and tell myself I'm strong
Because, saw her today, I saw her face
It was the face I love, and I knew 
I had to run away
And get down on my knees and pray, that they go away
And still it begins, needles and pins
Because of all my pride, the tears I gotta hide
Needle and pins, needle and pins, needle and pins

"No One To Blame"

I'm not lookin' for a friend   
I don't have such vanity
I walked alone into the woods
I don't take no sympathy

If that's the way it's gotta be
Well there's no more loyalty
Somebody always tryin' to complain
I don't need no one to blame

It's a bad, bad, bad day
I hope our paths never cross again
I needed just one break it never came
I kept my cool
I ain't the same

I had a lot of drinks and fun
It just made me sleepy
There's not much that I want to say
I never said I am sorry

It's a bad, bad, bad day
I hope our paths never cross again
On weekends if it decides to rain
I watch my friends go down the drain

I'm not looking for a friend
I don't have such vanity
I walked alone into the woods
I don't take no sympathy

"Roots Of Hatred"

i know your everything
well i know those tales you told
i smell them in the breeze
with every midnight break, i beg you take me please

i let my soul escape
well i let my blood run cold
so that my nerves would freeze
whatever it would take, to set my heart at ease

well later on it got so complicated
that little rock became the roots of hatred,
roots of hatred, roots of hatred, had me fallin'
fallin' apart, eatin', eatin' away all of my heart.

a secret hiding place 
you said there's very gold
under roots of all those trees
whatever it would take to set my heart at ease

well later on it got so complicated
that little rock became the roots of hatred,
roots of hatred, roots of hatred, had me fallin'
fallin' apart, eatin', eatin' away all of my heart.

Lying in bed one summer's night Everything wasn't alright
Something started crawling on me
A S-L-U-G

I saw her walking in the woods last night
And I knew something wasn't right
S-L-U-G
No no no no why'd she have to go-oh-oh-oh
No no no no why'd she have to go-oh-oh-oh

And I know that if I had her back today
Yeah I know (I know) I know (I know)
Why is it always this way?

'Cause summer's here and the time is right 
For fighting in the street, boy

But what can a poor boy do
Except to sing for a rock 'n' roll band
'Cause in sleepy London town
There's just no place for a street fighting man, no

Hey, think the time is right for a palace revolution
But where I live the game to play is compromise solution

'Cause in sleepy London town
There's just no place for a street fighting man, no

Hey, said my name is called disturbance
I'll shout and scream, I'll kill the king, I'll rail at all his servants
